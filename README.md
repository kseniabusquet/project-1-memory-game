## General Info

Memory game has long been a favorite game for all generations. It is easy to play, requires observation, concentration and a good memory to win. This game version is supposed to be played by a single player

## Game Rules
- The deck contains 12 cards in total with different food emojis
- Before the game start and the start of every round the cards are shuffled to appear in a random order
- The game starts after pressing the **START** button
- The moves counter and the countdown timer start counting with the start of the game
- The player has 40 seconds to complete the round
- The round can be resetted (started over) by clicking on the **RESET** button
- There is a maximum of 3 rounds per game as well as 3 resets in total
- The goal is to match all the 12 cards with the minimum amount of moves and the shortest time possible

## Game Flow
- Player clicks on **START**
- Player chooses 2 cards and tries to find 2 cards which are exactly the same
- If the player clickes on the card before clicking on **START**, a browser alert will be shown saying _"Please press the START button to start the game ü§ó"_
- If the cards are a match, they will be kept flipped over
- If the cards are not a match, they will be flipped back again
- The game continues until all the the cards have been paired up
- If the countdown reached 0, and not all the cards have been flipped over, the round counts as los, and a message _"Round lost :("_ will be displayed
-  When the round is finished, the results will be displayed on the left hand-side, including the round number, the total time spent and the number of moves
-  In case the round was started over with the **RESET** button, a message _"Round number #... resetted"_ will be displayed
-  After 3 rounds played, the round with the best results will be displayed: _"The round with the best results: round #... with ... moves under ... seconds"_ 
-  By the same number of moves, the shortest time will be considered and the following message will be displayed: _"There is more than one round with the best results: round #... and round #... with ... moves under ... seconds"_
-  If no round was played (only lost or resetted), the game is considered **lost** and the following message will be displayed _"Game lost. Please try again üòâ"_

## Game Over
The game is considered to be over when the maximum number of 3 rounds is achieved or no round was played.
